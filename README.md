## My Personal [https://github.com/jonrad/profilerate](Profilerate) Settings

* Fully commented. Delete what you want
* `personal.sh` - My personal shell settings. Includes fallback prompt that works cross shell (zsh, bash, sh)
* `init.lua` - Init file for neovim. It loads the `vimrc` first and then the the rest of the neovim settings
* `vimrc` - Init file for vim (No neovim features here). Has the basic settings I expect everywhere (tabwidth etc)
* Everything else is either part of [https://github.com/jonrad/profilerate](profilerate) or [https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim](kickstart.nvim)
